/*
 *
 * ü¶ã Bean Scopes:
 * ¬∑ In Spring, the scope of beans defines how the framework manages the object instances.
 *      ¬∑ Spring bean scopes: ¬∑ Singleton ¬∑ Prototype
 *
 * ‚ú¶ Singleton:
 * ¬∑ Singleton scope is default in Spring. It called singleton, because you always get the same instance when you refer to a specific bean.
 * ¬∑ When we call beans more than one time and want to get a different object each time, we can go to the bean
 *   class, and we can use @Scope("prototype") annotation. Then it will return different objects.
 *
 * ‚ú¶ Prototype:
 * ¬∑ It is called prototype, because every time you request a reference to a prototype-scoped bean, Spring creates a new object's instance.
 * ¬∑ For prototype beans, Spring does not create and manage an object's instance directly. The framework manages the
 *   object‚Äôs type and creates a new instance every time someone requests a reference to the bean.
 * ¬∑ We should use @Scope() annotation to change the bean‚Äôs scope. A new instance will be created each time we refer to it.
 *
 * ü¶ã Eager and Lazy Instantiation
 * ¬∑ When a container initializes (created), ALL Singleton BEANS are created automatically. It is DEFAULT behavior and called ‚Äúeager instantiation‚Äù.
 * ¬∑ We can use @Lazy annotation to prevent that. @Lazy will prevent creation of the beans until we refer to them.
