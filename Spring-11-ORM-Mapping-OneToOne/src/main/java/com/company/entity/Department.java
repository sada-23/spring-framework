/*
 * ðŸ¦‹ Bidirectional Relationship
 *
 * @OneToOne(mappedBy = "department")
 * Â· We would like to bring employee detail whenever we needed from the department object but Department Table is NOT
 *   owner in this relationship. Owner is Employee table. When we annotate the "private Employee employee;" field only
 *   with @OneToOne() annotation it will create employee field (column) in the department table which will be the foreign key.
 *   We don't want to create employee foreign key column in the Department Table. To prevent that we use the (mappedBy = "department"),
 *   with the @OneToOne() annotation.
 * Â· (mappedBy = "department") will map the employee field to the department reference that we have in the Employee class.
 *   In this way, the employee column will NOT be created on the department table, and we will still be able to reach the
 *   employee fields when we call it with employee.getDepartment.
