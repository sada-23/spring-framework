/*
 *
 * ðŸ¦‹ Spring MVC Architecture: Model, View, Controller
 * â€¢ The client sends an HTTP request to the web server.
 * â€¢ The dispatcher servlet uses the handler mapping to find out what controller action to call.
 * â€¢ The dispatcher servlet calls the controllerâ€™s action.
 * â€¢ After executing the action associated with the HTTP request, the controller returns the view name (and data to view)
 *   the dispatcher servlet needs to render into the HTTP response.
 * â€¢ The response sent back to the client.
 *
 *
 * â€¢ @Controller annotation indicates that the annotated class is controller.
 * â€¢ The controller actions are methods associated with specific HTTP requests.
 * â€¢ It is specialization of @Component and is autodetected through classpath scanning.
 * â€¢ It is typically used in combination with annotated handler methods based on the @RequestMapping annotation.
 *
 * â€¢ @RequestMapping annotation maps HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers
 * â€¢ It can be applied to class level and/or method level.
 *
 *
 * Â· Ex: When we send a request to the http://localhost:8080/home in browser, the dispatcher server will look for all the
 *   classes that are annotated with @Controller annotation and then go inside the class to find a method that is annotated
 *   with @RequestMapping("/home")
 *

    }

    @RequestMapping("/welcome")
    public String home2(){
        return "welcome.html";
    }

    // - If we don't provide an endpoint, it takes the default option @RequestMapping("/"), which is one slash
